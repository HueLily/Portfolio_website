# SWE Portfolio

Welcome to my Software Engineering Portfolio! This repository presents and hightlights my journey as a Computer Science major. This portfolio features my work, experience, technical skills, projects and activities that I have completed and I am developing.   

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
